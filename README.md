# Advanced Process Control (APC) in Petroleum Refineries

This repository hosts an interactive, single-page report that explores how Advanced Process Control (APC) technologies optimize petroleum refinery operations. The site is built with plain HTML enhanced by Tailwind CSS and Chart.js delivered from public CDNs, so no build tooling is required.

## Contents

- `index.html` – The main web experience featuring:
  - An overview dashboard summarizing ROI, market size, and operational improvements enabled by APC.
  - Topic-specific sections that dive into fundamentals, market landscape, ROI analysis, and the impact of AI/ML.
  - Interactive visualizations powered by Chart.js to highlight market share and ROI comparisons.
- `APC in Petroleum Refineries.pdf` – A reference document that complements the web report with additional reading material.

## Getting Started

No local build step is necessary. To explore the report:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` directly in your preferred web browser.

```
 git clone <repo-url>
 cd APC
 open index.html  # use `xdg-open` or double-click on Windows/Linux
```

Because the page loads Tailwind CSS and Chart.js from CDNs, an internet connection is required to see full styling and interactive charts.

## Contributing

Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests with improvements, additional data visualizations, or expanded documentation. Please ensure any contributions maintain the current lightweight, static-site approach so the report stays easy to host and share.
